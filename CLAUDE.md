# LLM Wiki


A personal knowledge base maintained by Claude Code.
Based on Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern.


## Purpose


This wiki is a structured, interlinked knowledge base capturing Thomas's personal software development philosophy.
Claude maintains the wiki. The human curates sources, asks questions, and guides the analysis.


## Folder structure


```
raw/          -- source documents (immutable -- never modify these)
wiki/         -- markdown pages maintained by Claude
wiki/index.md -- table of contents for the entire wiki
wiki/log.md   -- append-only record of all operations
```


## Ingest workflow


When the user adds a new source to `raw/` and asks you to ingest it:


1. Read the full source document
2. Discuss key takeaways with the user before writing anything
3. Create a summary page in `wiki/` named after the source
4. Create or update concept pages for each major idea or entity
5. Add wiki-links ([[page-name]]) to connect related pages
6. Update `wiki/index.md` with new pages and one-line descriptions
7. Append an entry to `wiki/log.md` with the date, source name, and what changed


A single source may touch 10-15 wiki pages. That is normal.


## Page format


Every wiki page should follow this structure:


```markdown
# Page Title


**Summary**: One to two sentences describing this page.


**Sources**: List of raw source files this page draws from.


**Last updated**: Date of most recent update.


---


Main content goes here. Use clear headings and short paragraphs.


Link to related concepts using [[wiki-links]] throughout the text.


## Related pages


- [[related-concept-1]]
- [[related-concept-2]]
```


## Citation rules


- Every factual claim should reference its source file
- Use the format (source: filename.pdf) after the claim
- If two sources disagree, note the contradiction explicitly
- If a claim has no source, mark it as needing verification


## Question answering


When the user asks a question:


1. Read `wiki/index.md` first to find relevant pages
2. Read those pages and synthesize an answer
3. Cite specific wiki pages in your response
4. If the answer is not in the wiki, say so clearly
5. If the answer is valuable, offer to save it as a new wiki page


Good answers should be filed back into the wiki so they compound over time.


## Lint


When the user asks you to lint or audit the wiki:


- Check for contradictions between pages
- Find orphan pages (no inbound links from other pages)
- Identify concepts mentioned in pages that lack their own page
- Flag claims that may be outdated based on newer sources
- Check that all pages follow the page format above
- Report findings as a numbered list with suggested fixes


## Rules


- Never modify anything in the `raw/` folder
- Always update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` after changes
- Keep page names lowercase with hyphens (e.g. `machine-learning.md`)
- Write in clear, plain language
- When uncertain about how to categorize something, ask the user

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
